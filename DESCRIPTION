        Diagnostic

Description: 
  Implementation of Warnes & Raftery's MCGibbsit run-length and 
  convergence diagnostic for a set of (not-necessarily independent) 
  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers.  It combines the quantile 
  estimate error-bounding approach of the Raftery and Lewis MCMC run
  length diagnostic `gibbsit` with the between verses within chain 
  approach of the Gelman and Rubin MCMC convergence diagnostic.
